 Summary: I Created 3 mini web Api's based off of previous Mini challenges. This assignment was easy at first, but applying data validation was certainly no easy task. I stuggled so much in fact I decieded to turn the assignment in late, and STILL didn't get it working the way I wanted. Overall, Very insightful hw!

 Peer Review: Everything works fine. The only thing I would suggest is instead of having three separate string outputs your should narrow it down to oneso the user can type in the category. Other than that great job!
